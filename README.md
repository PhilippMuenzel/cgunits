# cgunits
fork of the Calum Grant Unit library, adapted for C++17 constexpr

The CG units library is a lightweight unit library, less complete than boost::units, but very easy to use. 
The original CG units has disappeared from the Internet. This fork tries to keep the library alive and useful with modern C++.
